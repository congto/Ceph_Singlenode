# Install Ceph on Single Node

A quick guide for installing Ceph on a single node for demo purposes. It almost goes without saying that this is for tire-kickers who just want to test out the software. Ceph is a powerful distributed storage platform with a focus on spreading the failure domain across disks, servers, racks, pods, and datacenters. It doesn’t get a chance to shine if limited to a single node. With that said, let’s get on with it.
